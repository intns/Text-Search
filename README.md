# Text-Search
A tiny program made for searching text files Notepad++ doesn't want to

## Usage
To input the file you want to search, you may drag and drop the text file (or provide the file using a command line) on the executable, if no files were provided on the command line the program will ask for a path to the file.

Once you have entered a file successfully and it has been opened (no errors will have occured), it will ask for the text you want to search for. Once it begins searching if it is found then it will return the line number that matches, and the line itself.
